<p> <font size="4">John McCarthy was an American computer scientist. McCarthy was one of the founders of the discipline of artificial intelligence. He created the term "artificial intelligence" (AI), developed the Lisp programming language family, significantly influenced the design of the ALGOL programming language, popularized timesharing, and was very influential in the early development of AI.fter short-term appointments at Princeton and Stanford University, McCarthy became an assistant professor at Dartmouth in 1955.

A year later, McCarthy moved to MIT as a research fellow in the autumn of 1956.

In 1962, McCarthy became a full professor at Stanford, where he remained until his retirement in 2000. By the end of his early days at MIT he was already affectionately referred to as "Uncle John" by his students.

McCarthy championed mathematical logic for artificial intelligence.

John McCarthy is one of the "founding fathers" of artificial intelligence, together with Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon. McCarthy coined the term "artificial intelligence" in 1955, and organized the famous Dartmouth Conference in Summer 1956. This conference started AI as a field. (Marvin Minsky later joined McCarthy at MIT in 1959.)
In 1958, he proposed the advice taker, which inspired later work on question-answering and logic programming.
John McCarthy invented Lisp in the late 1950s. Based on the lambda calculus, Lisp soon became the programming language of choice for AI applications after its publication in 1960.[10]
Around 1959, he invented so-called "garbage collection" methods to solve problems in Lisp.
He helped to motivate the creation of Project MAC at MIT when he worked there.
At Stanford University, he helped establish the Stanford AI Laboratory, for many years a friendly rival to Project MAC.
